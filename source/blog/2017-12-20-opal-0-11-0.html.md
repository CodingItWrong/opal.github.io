Hello everyone!

I'm very happy to announce that after more than a year in the making Opal v0.11.0 has finally been released!

This version is probably the last one before 1.0, it's packed with great new features, a ton of fixes and a complete reimplementation of the parser.


## Notable Changes since Opal v0.10.0

<!--preview-->

### Renewed parser

The new parser is much more stricter, expect some code that was happily parsed be for to be rejected.
The good news is that the error messages are generally much better and will tell you exactly where to look, also your code will be more correct.

### Constant lookup

The constants lookup system has been rewritten and now the algorithm matches more closely what MRI does while still taking advantage of an aggressive cache.

### Sprockets extraction

Opal::Server was relying on Sprockets which is now extracted to the resurrected `opal-sprockets` gem and can be found under `Opal::Sprockets::Server`.

The `opal` gem sill provides a basic server that uses the internal `Opal::Builder` instead of sprockets and can be accessed as `Opal::SimpleServer` and has kept the same API where possible.

### Headless Chrome

Headless Chrome is the new standard, while `phantomjs` has been officially abandoned.

Opal v0.11.0 replaced the `phantomjs` CLI runner with `chrome`. While there's no plan to restore support for `phantomjs` if your app really needs it please contact the core team on [GitHub](https://github.com/opal/opal/issues/new) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/opal/opal), if there's enough interest we'll do our best to extract and publish `phantomjs` runner code as an external gem.

### Dynamic requires

Pre-compiling Ruby into JavaScript doesn't go along well with dynamic requires, but Opal [goes out of its way](https://github.com/opal/opal/blob/v0.11.0/lib/opal/nodes/call.rb#L311-L364) to cover all possible cases where it can infer the required path (e.g. parses calls to `File.expand_path` and resolves them at compile time).

Previously whenever a call to require couldn't be solved it ended in raising an exception and blocked the compilation, often unnecessarily forcing the user to add the requested path to stubs (see Opal::Config documentation).

With Opal v0.11.0 unsolvable calls to require will just be ignored at compile time and will raise a  `LoadError` at runtime if the given path isn't found matching more closely what happens under MRI. It's still possibile to revert back to the old behavior by settings `Opal::Config.dynamic_require_severity = :error` (see the relevant code in [opal/config.rb](https://github.com/opal/opal/blob/v0.11.0/lib/opal/config.rb#L101-L108)).
